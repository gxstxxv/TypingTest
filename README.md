# TypingTest
A simple typing test for the terminal written in java.

You start with a "sentence" consisting of 7 to 15 English words

When you press Enter, the test starts. Now you have to type out all the words one by one. 

Once you have finished, an analysis follows. This shows errors directly from the point where they occurred.
You also get information about the WPM and your accuracy.

If you leave out entire words, this is also displayed and you will not see an analysis of the accuracy or WPM.
